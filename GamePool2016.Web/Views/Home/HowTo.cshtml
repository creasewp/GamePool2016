    <h3><b>Select a winning team...</b></h3>
    <ul>
        First, browse to
        <a href="\MyPicks.aspx">My Picks</a>.

        Then click on the name of the team you predict will win that bowl game.
        <br />
        <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\SelectTeam.png" Height="70" />
        <br />
        Your choice will be identified with a thumbs up icon.

    </ul>


    <h3><b>Change your Ranking Score...</b></h3>
    <ul id="list">
        <li>
            The default mode is 'Worksheet Mode'. In this mode, you must enter your confidence score for each game in the appropriate textbox.</br>
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\WorksheetConfidence.png" Height="70" /></br>
            After entering your confidence score for all the games, click <a href='#saveChanges'>here</a> to learn how to save your changes.
        </li>
        </br>
        <strong>-- OR --</strong>
        </br></br>
        Unchecking the 'Worksheet Mode' checkbox enables movement of games as described below.</br>

        There are two ways to change your Ranking Score for a bowl game.
        <br />

        <li>
            Click on the green Up or Down arrow to move a game up or down one at a time
            <br />
            For example, if the current bowl game has a Ranking Score of 38,<br />
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\RankScore38.png" Height="70" /> <br />
            clicking the down arrow will change the ranking score to 37.<br />
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\RankScore37.png" Height="70" /> <br />
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\blank square.png" Height="30" />
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to move a game more than one at a time, click the Edit link<br />
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\EditRankScore.png" Height="70" /> <br />
            This will provide a textbox where you can manually type in a new rank score. Click Update to update your list.<br />
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\EditTextboxRankScore.png" Height="70" /> <br />
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\blank square.png" Height="30" />
        </li>
        <li>
            Once updated, your list should look something like this. </br>
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\MovedTo15.png" Height="210" /> <br />
            Note that each game must have a unique Ranking Score. When you move a game using the Edit link,
            the website will re-calculate the other games to make room for your change.
            <br />
            <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\blank square.png" Height="30" />
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="saveChanges">
        </br>
        </br>
    </div>
    <h3><b>Save your changes</b></h3>
    <ul>
        When ready, be sure to save your changes. Click the Save Changes button at the top of the
        <a href="\MyPicks.aspx">My Picks</a> page.
        <br />
        <asp:Image runat="server" ImageUrl="\Images\SaveChanges.png" Height="180" />
        <br />
    </ul>

    <h3><b>Track your progress</b></h3>
    <ul>
        Once the games have started, you can see how you did on individual game by going back to the
        <a href="\MyPicks.aspx">My Picks</a> page.
        <br />
        Here, you can see when each game is scheduled to be played.
        <br />
        When the game is over, you can see the final score and how many points you were awarded.
        <br />
        Below you can see that we picked the correct winner for the Gildan New Mexico Bowl and were awarded 2 points.
        <br />
        We did not pick the correct winner of the Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl and were awarded 0 points.
        <br />
